#+TITLE: Common Lisp and Python by examples


* Examples
I would like to share some examples that have written by me, so you can enhance, fix or share them.
** lists
A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable.
*** Create a List:
**** Lisp
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setf thislist '("apple" "banana" "cherry"))
(format t "~a" thislist)
#+END_EXAMPLE
**** Python
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
#+END_EXAMPLE
